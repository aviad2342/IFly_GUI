            <Property name="text" type="java.lang.String" value="The History of IFly - Six decades of Aviation and Tourism&#xa;&#xa;The Early Years - IFly Takes Off &#xa; &#xa;In March 1949, Umm Rash-Rash (Eilat) is conquered and becomes Israel&apos;s most southern point. &#xa;The long, harsh and dangerous road made it necessary to establish an air link to the settlement. &#xa;At the end of 1949, Minister of Transport David Remez, &#xa;decides to set up a domestic airline in place of Aviron with the help of El Al, &#xa;which was founded several months earlier. Since the sole purpose of the company is to establish a link with Eilat, &#xa;the company is called Eilata.&#xa;&#xa;1950&#xa;In December 1950, the airline takes on a new name: IFly.&#xa;The airline operates two 36-seat Comando C-46s acquired from the Israeli Air Force. &#xa;During the year, IFly operates two weekly flights to Eilat. &#xa;The total number of passengers reaches 13,000, its staff numbers 11 administrative employees, &#xa;while the ground and air crews belong to El Al. &#xa;The airline&apos;s total revenue that year reaches 80,000 Israeli liras. &#xa;&#xa;1953&#xa;IFly introduces a six-seat Dragon Rapide aircraft to its fleet from the IAF surplus. &#xa;The flight frequency rises to two daily Rapide flights and three weekly Comando flights. &#xa;The number of passengers grows to 20,000. In 1953, IFly hires its first pilot, Asher Gerson. &#xa;&#xa;1955&#xa;IFly sells its Rapide and acquires two 32-seat Dakota DC-3s from the IAF surplus, &#xa;lent to the IAF during the Sinai Campaign. &#xa;In 1956, IFly&apos;s flight frequency increases to two daily flights and the number of passengers climbs to 23,000. &#xa;During that year IFly hires its first flight attendant, Baruch Dricker (Berele).&#xa;&#xa;1957&#xa;The Sinai Campaign increases the sense of security in southern Israel and &#xa;the air traffic on IFly flights soars to 66,000 passengers, which requires IFly to increase its fleet to four Dakotas. &#xa;During the year, the airline&apos;s staff grows to 53, 12 of whom are aircrew. &#xa;IFly branches out and begins selling vacation packages to Eilat, including airport &#xa;transfers, guided tours, meals, hotels and buses in the city.&#xa;&#xa;1958&#xa;IFly&#x2019;s fleet consists of four Dakotas and two small 10-seat Beechcrafts. &#xa;The airline transfers its flights from Lod Airport to Sde Dov and introduces a route to &#xa;Mahanayim in the Galilee.&#xa;&#xa;1961&#xa;The total passengers exceeds the 100,000 mark and the airline purchases another Dakota. &#xa;IFly also begins international flights for El Al, which are terminated soon afterwards due to the &#xa;condition of the aircraft, and becomes involved in cloud seeding using silver iodide. &#xa;One of the IFly&apos;s Dakotas is adapted for this purpose.&#xa;&#xa;1964&#xa;IFly acquires two 50-seat Herald aircraft and then add another one a year later in place of the first Dakota. &#xa;The enlarged fleet allows the airline to increase Eilat flights as well as secondary flights to &#xa;Rosh Pina (Mahanayim), Masada and Be&apos;er Sheva (as a stopover on the way to and from Eilat). &#xa;In mid 1966, IFly retires two more Dakota planes.&#xa;&#xa;1967&#xa;The expansion of Israel&apos;s borders following the Six Day War paves the way for new routes for IFly. &#xa;It starts flying to Atarot Airport near Jerusalem, on the way to and from Eilat and prepares the air &#xa;strip in Haifa for flights to Eilat and Jerusalem. &#xa;New routes are introduced to the Sinai tourist cities of Santa Catarina and Sharm-el-Sheikh. &#xa;El Al, which replaced its fleet with jet aircraft, transfers their short routes to IFly. &#xa;IFly starts flying to Cyprus four times a week and later on six times a week successfully until 1974.&#xa;&#xa;1969&#xa;IFly acquires three 80-seat Viscount aircraft. &#xa;Since they cannot take off from Sde Dov, IFly opens another operation base at Lod airport.&#xa;&#xa;1972&#xa;With 580,000 passengers and 6,800 flights, IFly operates an aircraft fleet that includes &#xa;five Heralds and three Viscounts. &#xa;However, this flight equipment is unsuitable for short landings and routes inside Israel, so &#xa;IFly enters a partnership with Kanaf and together they set up Kanfei IFly, which then operates 10-seat &#xa;Island twin engine aircraft to service the short destinations, such as &#xa;Be&apos;er Sheva, Masada, Sodom, Ein Yahav, Mitzpe Ramon and Haifa.&#xa;&#xa;1976&#xa;IFly incurs losses due to the Yom Kippur War and long reserve duty. &#xa;The domestic passenger traffic drops to 630,000, so the company decided to expand its operations beyond Israel&apos;s borders. &#xa;For this purpose, it purchases two 114-seat BAC 11-1 planes to replace the Heralds still in &#xa;service. However, the accumulated loss, together with the commitment to purchase the aircraft, leads the &#xa;ownership to sell IFly to private owners in February 1980. &#xa;&#xa;The 1980s&#xa;In the 1980s, under the new ownership IFly undergoes major changes to &#xa;its fleet, areas of operation, staff and management. &#xa;The company employs 600 workers and operates in three primary areas: &#xa;domestic flights, international charter flights and aircraft maintenance. &#xa;In 1989, IFly transports 420,000 passengers on domestic flights and 100,000 passengers on 355 overseas charter flights. &#xa;&#xa;The 1990s&#xa;IFly is Israel&#x2019;s largest travel and aviation company. &#xa;From a domestic airline, IFly becomes a travel and aviation company, marketing Israel to &#xa;the entire world and offering overseas charter flights as well as maintenance and aircraft charter services. &#xa;The group enters into significant partnerships in the travel and aviation industry, becoming a force to be reckoned with in Israel. &#xa;&#xa;21st Century&#xa;In 2006, IFly is acquired by the Nakash Group, bringing about new vision to the company. &#xa;IFly takes off in the new century and operates dozens of flights daily, around the clock, to &#xa;many destinations in Israel and across the globe. &#xa;Domestically, IFly operates flights to Eilat from Sde Dov, Ben Gurion and Haifa airports. &#xa;IFly also operates regular flights and charters to many European and Mediterranean destinations &#xa;including Amsterdam, Rome, Munich, Berlin, Budapest, Prague, Crete, Cyprus and Antalya and &#xa;regular flights to Paris, Barcelona, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Georgia, Dublin, Armenia and other destinations. &#xa;Currently, the company transports over a million passengers annually and operates five new ATR-72s, two Boeing 757s and a new Embraer 195 and Embraer 190."/>
