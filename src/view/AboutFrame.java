Since the sole purpose of the company is to establish a link with Eilat, \nthe company is called Eilata.\n\n1950\nIn December 1950, the airline takes on a new name: IFly.\nThe airline operates two 36-seat Comando C-46s acquired from the Israeli Air Force. \nDuring the year, IFly operates two weekly flights to Eilat. \nThe total number of passengers reaches 13,000, its staff numbers 11 administrative employees, \nwhile the ground and air crews belong to El Al. \nThe airline's total revenue that year reaches 80,000 Israeli liras. \n\n1953\nIFly introduces a six-seat Dragon Rapide aircraft to its fleet from the IAF surplus. \nThe flight frequency rises to two daily Rapide flights and three weekly Comando flights. \nThe number of passengers grows to 20,000. In 1953, IFly hires its first pilot, Asher Gerson. \n\n1955\nIFly sells its Rapide and acquires two 32-seat Dakota DC-3s from the IAF surplus, \nlent to the IAF during the Sinai Campaign. \nIn 1956, IFly's flight frequency increases to two daily flights and the number of passengers climbs to 23,000. \nDuring that year IFly hires its first flight attendant, Baruch Dricker (Berele).\n\n1957\nThe Sinai Campaign increases the sense of security in southern Israel and \nthe air traffic on IFly flights soars to 66,000 passengers, which requires IFly to increase its fleet to four Dakotas. \nDuring the year, the airline's staff grows to 53, 12 of whom are aircrew. \nIFly branches out and begins selling vacation packages to Eilat, including airport \ntransfers, guided tours, meals, hotels and buses in the city.\n\n1958\nIFly’s fleet consists of four Dakotas and two small 10-seat Beechcrafts. \nThe airline transfers its flights from Lod Airport to Sde Dov and introduces a route to \nMahanayim in the Galilee.\n\n1961\nThe total passengers exceeds the 100,000 mark and the airline purchases another Dakota. \nIFly also begins international flights for El Al, which are terminated soon afterwards due to the \ncondition of the aircraft, and becomes involved in cloud seeding using silver iodide. \nOne of the IFly's Dakotas is adapted for this purpose.\n\n1964\nIFly acquires two 50-seat Herald aircraft and then add another one a year later in place of the first Dakota. \nThe enlarged fleet allows the airline to increase Eilat flights as well as secondary flights to \nRosh Pina (Mahanayim), Masada and Be'er Sheva (as a stopover on the way to and from Eilat). \nIn mid 1966, IFly retires two more Dakota planes.\n\n1967\nThe expansion of Israel's borders following the Six Day War paves the way for new routes for IFly. \nIt starts flying to Atarot Airport near Jerusalem, on the way to and from Eilat and prepares the air \nstrip in Haifa for flights to Eilat and Jerusalem. \nNew routes are introduced to the Sinai tourist cities of Santa Catarina and Sharm-el-Sheikh. \nEl Al, which replaced its fleet with jet aircraft, transfers their short routes to IFly. \nIFly starts flying to Cyprus four times a week and later on six times a week successfully until 1974.\n\n1969\nIFly acquires three 80-seat Viscount aircraft. \nSince they cannot take off from Sde Dov, IFly opens another operation base at Lod airport.\n\n1972\nWith 580,000 passengers and 6,800 flights, IFly operates an aircraft fleet that includes \nfive Heralds and three Viscounts. \nHowever, this flight equipment is unsuitable for short landings and routes inside Israel, so \nIFly enters a partnership with Kanaf and together they set up Kanfei IFly, which then operates 10-seat \nIsland twin engine aircraft to service the short destinations, such as \nBe'er Sheva, Masada, Sodom, Ein Yahav, Mitzpe Ramon and Haifa.\n\n1976\nIFly incurs losses due to the Yom Kippur War and long reserve duty. \nThe domestic passenger traffic drops to 630,000, so the company decided to expand its operations beyond Israel's borders. \nFor this purpose, it purchases two 114-seat BAC 11-1 planes to replace the Heralds still in \nservice. However, the accumulated loss, together with the commitment to purchase the aircraft, leads the \nownership to sell IFly to private owners in February 1980. \n\nThe 1980s\nIn the 1980s, under the new ownership IFly undergoes major changes to \nits fleet, areas of operation, staff and management. \nThe company employs 600 workers and operates in three primary areas: \ndomestic flights, international charter flights and aircraft maintenance. \nIn 1989, IFly transports 420,000 passengers on domestic flights and 100,000 passengers on 355 overseas charter flights. \n\nThe 1990s\nIFly is Israel’s largest travel and aviation company. \nFrom a domestic airline, IFly becomes a travel and aviation company, marketing Israel to \nthe entire world and offering overseas charter flights as well as maintenance and aircraft charter services. \nThe group enters into significant partnerships in the travel and aviation industry, becoming a force to be reckoned with in Israel. \n\n21st Century\nIn 2006, IFly is acquired by the Nakash Group, bringing about new vision to the company. \nIFly takes off in the new century and operates dozens of flights daily, around the clock, to \nmany destinations in Israel and across the globe. \nDomestically, IFly operates flights to Eilat from Sde Dov, Ben Gurion and Haifa airports. \nIFly also operates regular flights and charters to many European and Mediterranean destinations \nincluding Amsterdam, Rome, Munich, Berlin, Budapest, Prague, Crete, Cyprus and Antalya and \nregular flights to Paris, Barcelona, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Georgia, Dublin, Armenia and other destinations. \nCurrently, the company transports over a million passengers annually and operates five new ATR-72s, two Boeing 757s and a new Embraer 195 and Embraer 190.");
